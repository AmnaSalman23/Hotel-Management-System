# Hotel Management System HMS

**Course:** Software Engineering Lab (CS165L)

**Developer:**  Mustafa Riaz

### Project Description:
The aim of this project is to design a hotel management system for running a hotel business. The system should be as flexible as possible so that it can be used for different hotels.
A hotel is a hive of operations that include front desk, booking and reservations, banquets, finance, HR, inventory, material management, quality management, security, energy management, housekeeping, and others. All these operations occur at the same time, making manual management impossible.

### Project Technology:
I will be creating an Android application designed for effortless accessibility and user-friendly usage.
